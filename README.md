# CodeAlpha_IrisClassification
Task 1 for CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model built with scikit-learn to classify Iris flower species.

# 🌸 CodeAlpha Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an Iris flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica) based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
* **Python**
* **pandas:** For loading and managing the `Iris.csv` dataset.
* **scikit-learn:**
    * `train_test_split`: To split the data into training and testing sets.
    * `KNeighborsClassifier`: The machine learning algorithm used.
    * `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`: To evaluate the model's performance.
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Results
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model was trained on the dataset and achieved **100% accuracy** on the unseen test data, perfectly classifying all samples.
